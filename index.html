    Hi. This is the home of the ResearchBuzz Search Gizmos, as kindly hosted by GitHub Pages.
</h2>

  <p>I've been making little programs to help me with Web search and related tasks for years. Until recently, however, I used Google Sheets as my platform;
    I didn't know how to make a Web app. Now that I'm learning JavaScript, I can translate some of my Google Sheets tools to tiny sharable Web apps and share them with you.
  </p>

<p>I have made hosted versions of all my little tools and invite you to goof around with them. Please note that the designs are very basic: it's just instructions and a form. </p>

<p>Stay tuned: I've only gotten started learning JavaScript and Python and there are about a billion things I'd like to make.</p>

<p>Here are the tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Receipts:</b> -- <a href="https://researchbuzz.github.io/Twitter-Receipts/index.html">https://researchbuzz.github.io/Twitter-Receipts/index.html</a><br><br> 
  Twitter Receipts has you enter a Twitter handle and a date, then queries The Wayback Machine for the closest snapshot of the Twitter handle to that date. The Wayback Machine page opens in a new URL. 
  Sometimes the API is a little slow so give it a few seconds.<br><br>

  <b>Back That Ask Up:</b> -- <a href="https://researchbuzz.github.io/Back-That-Ask-Up-/">https://researchbuzz.github.io/Back-That-Ask-Up-/</a><br><br> 
  Enter a Google News query and the number of days/months/years' worth of the most recent news items you want to eliminate.
  BTAU will construct a date-restricted search query in Google News and open it in a new window.

  <b>The Anti-Bullseye Name Search</b> -- <a href="https://researchbuzz.github.io/The-Anti-Bullseye-Name-Search/">https://researchbuzz.github.io/The-Anti-Bullseye-Name-Search/</a><br><br> 
  TABNS takes a name and generates a Google search that searches for the name in reverse order (Lastname Firstname) and specifically excludes the most common expression of firstname lastname. It changes the tenor of the search results completely, surfacing many more legal- and data- based results.<br><br>
It also removes a lot of commercial clutter from your search (Amazon, eBay, Pinterest, etc) and gives you the option of adding focusing keywords to the name search.

  <b>Sinker Search</b> -- <a href="https://researchbuzz.github.io/sinker-search/index.html">https://researchbuzz.github.io/sinker-search/index.html</a><br><br> 
  Takes full advantage of Google's 32-word query limit by letting you choose an emphasized word in your search, which will be repeated until Google's query limit is reached.
