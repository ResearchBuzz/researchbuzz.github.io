    Hi. This is the home of the ResearchBuzz Search Gizmos, as kindly hosted by GitHub Pages.
</h2>

  <p>I've been making little programs to help me with Web search and related tasks for years. Until recently, however, I used Google Sheets as my platform;
    I didn't know how to make a Web app. Now that I'm learning JavaScript, I can translate some of my Google Sheets tools to tiny sharable Web apps and share them with you.
  </p>

<p>I have made hosted versions of all my little tools and invite you to goof around with them. Please note that the designs are very basic: it's just instructions and a form. </p>

<p>Here are the tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Twitter Receipts:</b> -- <a href="https://researchbuzz.github.io/Twitter-Receipts/index.html">https://researchbuzz.github.io/Twitter-Receipts/index.html</a><br><br> 
  Twitter Receipts has you enter a Twitter handle and a date, then queries The Wayback Machine for the closest snapshot of the Twitter handle to that date. The Wayback Machine page opens in a new URL. 
  Sometimes the API is a little slow so give it a few seconds.<br><br>

<li>
  <b>Back That Ask Up:</b> -- <a href="https://researchbuzz.github.io/Back-That-Ask-Up-/">https://researchbuzz.github.io/Back-That-Ask-Up-/</a><br><br> 
  Enter a Google News query and the number of days/months/years' worth of the most recent news items you want to eliminate.
  BTAU will construct a date-restricted search query in Google News and open it in a new window.
